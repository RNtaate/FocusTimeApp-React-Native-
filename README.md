# Focus Time

## Project Description

> This project is a simple mobile application built in React Native to enable the user to focus on a specific task by entering the task at hand and specifying the amount of time he/she would like to focus on it.

> The project also keeps track of the tasks that were fully focused on already.

> #### Future Additional Features:
> - Ability to specify a custom time to focus on a task and not choose from a predifined list of times.
